# game_show_app_v1.2
 Treehouse Unit 6 Project


 This project showcases JavaScript in a fun, interactive word guessing game.
 The user will select a letter they believe to be in an unknown phrase. 
 If correct, the chosen letter will appear in the phrase. 
 If incorrect, the user will lose a "heart" token.
 The game ends if the user correctly guesses the phrase without losing all 
 the heart tokens. If all the tokens are lost before the phrase is guessed, 
 there will be a game over. A "Play Again button will be available to restart 
 the game.
